Introduction
------------

The `snippets2oval.sh` script creates OVAL files based on the snippets found in
various sub directories. It uses the definition(s) in the `definitions/`
location, parses them and then starts building the OVAL file by including the
referred snippets from other directories.

Usage
-----

```
~$ snippets2oval.sh /path/to/basedir
```
