Poor Man Central SCAP Agent
===========================

In this directory you will find one, perhaps later multiple scripts that all
implement the pmcsa logic in their own way. Considering its simple design, it
might be sufficient to stick with the scripted approach. If not, it'll change
later to C code.

Design
------

### Usage ###

```
~$ pmcsa [-d <port>] <repo-urn>
``` 

The `-id` option is to daemonize the agent.

### Streams ###

The streams refered to later have the following syntax:

```
<type>#<streampath>#<id>
```

If `<type>` is `xccdf`, then `<id>` is the profile name of the XCCDF

If `<type>` is `oval`, then `<id>` is the OVAL id

### Pseudo code - scheduled run ###

The following pseudo code shows how pmcsa functions for the scheduled run.

```
FQDN   = get system fully qualified hostname
DOMAIN = get system domain name (or "localdomain" if empty)
CLASS  = get system class

POSSIBLE_TARGETS = 
  <repo-urn>/config/domains/DOMAIN.conf
  <repo-urn>/config/classes/CLASS.conf
  <repo-urn>/config/domains/DOMAIN/classes/CLASS.conf
  <repo-urn>/config/hosts/FQDN.conf

Fetch configuration from POSSIBLE_TARGETS (overriding values):
  PLATFORM       = get platform from configuration
  KEYWORDS       = get keywords from configuration (comma separated)
  RESULTREPO     = get resultrepo from configuration
  SCAPSCANOVAL   = get scapscanneroval from configuration
  SCAPSCANXCCDF  = get scapscannerxccdf from configuration

STREAM_LISTS = 
  <repo-urn>/stream/hosts/FQDN/list.conf
  <repo-urn>/stream/domains/DOMAIN/classes/CLASS/platforms/PLATFORM/list.conf
  <repo-urn>/stream/domains/DOMAIN/classes/CLASS/list.conf
  <repo-urn>/stream/classes/CLASS/platforms/PLATFORM/list.conf
  <repo-urn>/stream/classes/CLASS/list.conf
  <repo-urn>/stream/domains/DOMAIN/list.conf
  [ for each KEYWORD in KEYWORDS: <repo-urn>/stream/keywords/KEYWORD/list.conf ]

STREAMS = Concatenate stream identifiers from all list.conf files

for each STREAM in STREAMS
  STREAMTYPE     = STREAM[0] # separated
  STREAMPATH     = STREAM[1] # separated
  STREAMID       = STREAM[2] # separated
  DATASTREAMFILE = fetch <repo-urn>/stream/STREAM

  ## SCAPSCAN{STREAMTYPE} -> depends on type!
  DSRESULT       = evaluate DATASTREAMFILE using SCAPSCAN{STREAMTYPE}
    Substitute @@STREAMNAME@@ with path to DATASTREAMFILE
    Substitute @@RESULTNAME@@ with path to DSRESULT
    Substitute @@STREAMID@@ with STREAMID
  send DSRESULT to RESULTREPO
    Substitute @@TARGETNAME@@ with FQDN
    Substitute @@FILENAME@@ with DSRESULT file name
```

### Pseudo code - ad-hoc run ###

```
(Reuse configuration from earlier part)

Bind webserver-functionality on PORT (argument)

for each REQUEST
  if REQUEST != GET /Evaluate?type=STREAMTYPE&path=STREAMPATH&id=STREAMID HTTP/1.0
    ignore request
  
  (reuse STREAM handling code from previous part)
```
