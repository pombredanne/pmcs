Poor Man Central SCAP
=====================

Introduction
------------

When working with SCAP content for its various use cases, there are already a
few open source projects that provide us with SCAP scanners. Open-SCAP is able
to test OVAL and XCCDF documents, but only locally (thus far). Ovaldi is a
similar one.

What is missing is a way to centrally work on SCAP content, having multiple
systems pull the necessary definitions from the central repository, "play" it
locally and send back the results to a central location.

There, on this central location, the reports can then be aggregated further to
make proper architectural decisions with a wider view on the situation, rather
than having to parse the reports individually.

Central management of SCAP content
----------------------------------

SCAP 1.2 already provides a way to have a single stream (SCAP data streams)
containing all SCAP content needed for a local system to properly test all that
is needed.

pmcs will use SCAP data streams by bundling the XCCDF, OVAL, CPE (and in the
future other protocols as well) for each target based on a prepared definition,
and offering the SCAP data stream as a single HTTP(S) resource.

Local SCAP scanners pull the SCAP data stream(s) needed for the system, based on
a set of system parameters (hostname, domainname, platform, class and generic
keywords). They evaluate the SCAP data stream(s) and send back the reports
towards a central repository.

Configurationless approach
--------------------------

One of the focus areas of pmcs is that the local components use SCAP scanners
already available. The first focus is on Open-SCAP and Ovaldi, but others should
be easy to integrate as we are focusing on the SCAP technologies.

The local pmcs agent has two roles: scheduling regular SCAP evaluations, and
waiting for triggers to do ad-hoc evaluations.

The scheduled evaluation does not need a daemonized agent; it can be perfectly
scheduled from a scheduler such as Cron, Windows Task Scheduler or even more
enterprise job schedulers. But we will support the daemonized approach as well
in case the administrator wants to use a built-in scheduler rather than the
system scheduler.

Only a single parameter should be passed on to the agent: the URN towards the
central configuration repository. For instance (pmcsa = pmcs agent):
```
~$ pmcsa https://cscapserver.localdomain/repo
```

The agent will then pull in the necessary information from this location.

Once information is obtained, the agent will download the SCAP content that it
needs to evaluate, evaluate it, and send the results to a central repository
(which does not need to be the same URN as the central configuration
repository).

Checking order
--------------

To handle the configuration as well as SCAP content in a manageable manner, the
agent will always look through the repository using the following order:

- Host-specific at `hosts/` using a fully qualified hostname
- Domain-specific with class information at `domains/classes/` using the class
- Class-specific at `classes/` using the class
- Domain-specific without class information at `domains/`
- Keyword-triggered (only for SCAP data streams) at `keywords/` using the
  keyword

So to obtain system configuration information, the *first* hit will be used (a
system can only have a single configuration entry).

To obtain SCAP data stream(s), *all* hits are used (a system can evaluate
various SCAP data streams).

Reporting repository
--------------------

The evaluated results are sent to a central repository. There, a per-host result
directory is kept for each day (for the scheduled streams) or invocation (for
the ad-hoc results).

Ad-hoc invocations
------------------

Sometimes administrators want to push out certain checks towards one or more
systems without having to wait for a particular scheduled run. We need to
support this, which means that the pmcsa (pmsc agent) will also support a
daemonized setup to which administrators can push evaluation requests (using
pmcsc - pmcs client):
```
~$ pmcsc eval scap_org.gentoo.dev.swift_datastream_cve-2013-3312 class=unix
```

The client in the above case will check what the target systems are with the
"unix" class, and then push out the request to evaluate the given data stream.
The daemonized agents will pull this data stream from the `ad-hoc/` location,
evaluate and send it to the central report location where the reports are stored
in a specific ad-hoc location, with the results for each server.

External software requirements
------------------------------

The pmcs setup wouldn't be a "poor man" setup if we wouldn't leverage existing
infrastructure as much as possible.

* To build the SCAP data streams, we assume the administrator does this himself.
  This can be accomplished with tools such as open-scap.
* The first central repositories are simple HTTP directory structures; pmcs will
  provide a few scripts to easily manage those. The idea is that, if you want to
  manage this repository, it is assumed you use a git (or other version control
  system) repository.
* The target repository to save files in will, at first, be a simple CGI script
  to run on a web server. Authentication against the repositories is assumed to
  be handled using the system's server certificates if applicable.
